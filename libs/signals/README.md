# signals

Signals is a low-level library that provides [signal/slot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signals_and_slots)
and [functional reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming)-like primitives.
It can serve as the basis for a user interface toolkit, or any other library that has a model on which clients will
listen and to which they will react.

Signals is originally based on [React-as3](https://github.com/tconkling/react-as3).

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test signals` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
